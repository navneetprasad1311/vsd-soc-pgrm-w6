# *Week 6* VSD RISC-V Tapeout Program ![Hands-On Physical Design](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hands_On_Physical_Design-Done-darkgreen)

To perform hands-on Physical Design labs using a pre-configured VDI image and understand the complete hierarchy of digital and mixed-signal design implementation, from standard cell design to DRC and STA validation.

## Objectives

- **Gain practical experience** with open-source EDA tools using the pre-configured VDI environment.  
- **Understand the full physical design flow** — from standard cell design to final chip layout and verification.  
- **Explore the hierarchy of digital and mixed-signal implementation**, linking front-end (RTL) to back-end (layout) stages.  
- **Perform standard cell characterization**, including layout creation, LEF extraction, and library integration.  
- **Execute floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing** using OpenLANE and related open-source tools.  
- **Build and validate the Power Distribution Network (PDN)** to ensure stable power delivery across the chip.  
- **Conduct Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)** for manufacturability and correctness.  
- **Run Static Timing Analysis (STA)** to verify setup and hold timing across different PVT corners.  
- **Develop an understanding of timing closure**, ECO strategies, and their impact on design quality.  
- **Connect theory to practice**, reinforcing key physical design concepts such as floorplanning, routing, and timing optimization.
